# TODO

- [ ] [Trimmed whitespace shows up in the undo stack](https://github.com/chrisant996/vscode-autotrim/issues/3) -- Maybe the `undoStopAfter` and `undoStopBefore` options in the `editor.edit()` function can help?
- [ ] [Setting to exclude files with globbing](https://github.com/chrisant996/vscode-autotrim/issues/2)
- [ ] [Markdown files trim when more than 2 trailing spaces](https://github.com/chrisant996/vscode-autotrim/issues/1)
